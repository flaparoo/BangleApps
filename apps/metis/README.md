# Metis - THE Info App

Would you like to know when the sun rises or sets? What's the temperature? Or your current heart rate? How many steps did you take today? What's the stae-of-charge of the battery? Is Bluetooth on and connected? Are any of the sensors in use? How much of the flash memory and RAM are being used? What is the answer to life, the universe and everything? Ok, maybe it can't answer that one - but it will provide 42 other bits of wisdom (hence Metis: the Greek goddess of wisdom and deep thought).
