# Aviation Weather (AVWX)

Shows the latest METAR and TAF for the nearest airport


## Requirements

The METAR/TAF information is obtained from [AVWX](https://account.avwx.rest/). You will need an account and generate an API token. The free "Hobby" plan is sufficient, but please consider supporting the AVWX project.

The API token is required during the installation of the app on your Bangle.
